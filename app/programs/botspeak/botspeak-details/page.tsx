                Botspeak is a series of YouTube videos, books, and articles teaching AI Fluency. We believe that conversing with AI systems is the new frontier of human-computer interaction. Just as traveling to a foreign country becomes infinitely more rewarding when you speak the local language, navigating the world of large language models requires more than just basic phrases and borrowed terminology.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                Our mission is to transform you from an AI tourist into a fluent "Botspeak" native through the mastery of Delegation, Description, Discernment, and Diligence - the four core competencies that transcend mere prompt engineering trends. The framework serves as the conceptual foundation for Botspeak, primarily delivered through a YouTube series hosted by Nik Bear Brown, PhD, Associate Teaching Professor at Northeastern University's College of Engineering.

                The Botspeak framework integrates established theories from critical thinking development (Paul-Elder Framework, Bloom's Taxonomy, Argument Mapping), understanding of stochastic processes (Bayesian Reasoning, Probabilistic Thinking), experiential learning (Kolb's Learning Cycle, Cognitive Apprenticeship Model, Deliberate Practice), and design thinking (adapted five-stage process, lateral thinking, prototype theory).

                The YouTube series translates this theoretical framework into practical learning through a show-and-tell format where Dr. Brown builds interesting AI projects while explaining exactly how they work. Viewers receive all necessary tools and resources to implement these skills themselves, with episodes progressively building from foundational to advanced capabilities.
